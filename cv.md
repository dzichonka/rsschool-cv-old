## Code example:

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

```
function squareDigits(num) {
    let result = "";
    if (Number.isInteger(num)) {
        let index = num.toString();
        for (let i = 0; i < index.length; i++) {
            let indexNum = +index.substr(i, 1);
            result += `${indexNum * indexNum}`;
        }
        return +result;
    } else {
        result = "The function accepts an integer";
        return result;
    }
}
```
